// Map vs ForEach

// Map is a function in js that return a new array after applying a callback fucntion on each element. It returns a new array. It does not mutate the original array. For eg : arr.map((element)=>element*2)

// Foreach : it is used to execute a fucntion on each element on the given array. It does return undefined. It mutates the original array. arr.forEach((element)=>element*2)
